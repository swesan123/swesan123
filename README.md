**`AI Enthusiast | Weeb | Gamer`**

I'm a 5th-year Software Engineering student at McMaster University finishing my final year graduating 2026.  
I love building and making my life more efficient from apps that solve small daily problems to full-stack tools that automate tasks.  
Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into **applied machine learning**, experimenting with real-world datasets and building AI-driven projects that excite me.  
When I’m not coding, I’m usually watching anime or gaming.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Swesan’s Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 I started my journey exploring how software can make life more efficient from student apps to AI projects.  
 Over time, I’ve grown passionate about automation, backend systems, and applying machine learning to solve real problems.  
 I love experimenting, learning, and improving my workflows and if it’s fun to build, I’m already on it.

 In my childhood, my first exposure to programming was through **HTML and CSS** web development instantly caught my attention because it was such a creative space.  
 By the time I hit high school, I started experimenting with **Java**, mainly to learn how to mod in *Minecraft*, which at the time was written in Java. That ended up teaching me a ton about logic, object-oriented programming, and even sparked my interest in game development.  
 Eventually, I picked up **Python**, and it quickly became my go-to language from writing automation scripts to building ML models, it’s been the one I rely on most.  
 I’ve never really limited myself to a single language; I pick up whatever tool or language fits the problem I’m trying to solve. Whether it’s backend systems, AI, or random side projects, I’m always learning something new to get the job done.
